Problem Description:
Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

Solution Explanation:
This solution uses an inorder traversal of the binary search tree to find the kth smallest element. 
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. Inorder Traversal:
   - In a binary search tree (BST), an inorder traversal visits the nodes in ascending order of their values.
   - The traversal order is: left subtree, current node, right subtree.

2. Implementation Details:
   - We use a class variable `self.result` to store the values of nodes as we traverse.
   - The `inorder` helper function performs the traversal recursively.
   - We append each node's value to `self.result` during the traversal.
   - To optimize, we stop the traversal once we have k elements in `self.result`.

3. Time and Space Complexity:
   - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, we might need to visit all nodes.
   - Space Complexity: O(n) for the recursion stack and to store the result list.

4. Alternative Approaches:
   - For large trees with frequent queries, we could augment the BST nodes with a 'size' field (number of nodes in its subtree).
   - Another approach could be to use a generator function for lazy evaluation, which would be more memory efficient for large k.

Below is the implementation:
"""

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        self.result = []

        def inorder(node):
            if node is None:
                return
            inorder(node.left)
            self.result.append(node.val)
            if len(self.result) >= k:
                return
            else:
                inorder(node.right)
        
        inorder(root)
        return self.result[k-1]

"""
Usage:
To use this solution, you would typically:
1. Create a binary search tree.
2. Instantiate the Solution class.
3. Call the kthSmallest method with the root of your BST and the desired k value.

Example:
    # Assuming you have a BST with root node 'root'
    solution = Solution()
    k = 3
    third_smallest = solution.kthSmallest(root, k)
    print(f"The {k}th smallest element is: {third_smallest}")

Note: This solution assumes that k is valid (i.e., 1 <= k <= number of nodes in the BST).
