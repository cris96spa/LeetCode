        Given an array of CPU tasks labeled with letters from A to Z and an integer n,
        return the minimum number of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks,
        ensuring that the same task appears at least 'n' intervals apart.

        Args:
        tasks (List[str]): A list of task labels.
        n (int): The cooling period between two identical tasks.

        Returns:
        int: The minimum number of CPU intervals required.

        Complexity Analysis:
        - Building the max heap: O(k log k), where k is the number of unique tasks.
        - Running the scheduling loop: O(m log k), where m is the number of tasks.
        - Overall: O(m log k), where k â‰¤ 26 (constant in practice).
